                        <p>Just the right amount of study for year round wear. soft to the
                        <br>touch but built for a decade of solid wear. Oxford is a perfectly
                        <br>versatile fabric that looks just as good pressed as it does pulled
                        <br>off the back of a chair. While traditional cotton uses 25 percent 
                        <br>of the world's pesticides , our organic cotton doesn't use a drug.
                        <br>better shirt, responsibly built for the long haul. </p>
